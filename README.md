## What's new?

I am a web developer / mobile game developer with hands-on experience and continuous self-development. I develop web apps with clean user interfaces to drive positive user experience and keep users more engaged with animated interactions. I also develop mobile games that keep players attracted to story-telling game design and interactivity with other enthusiastic players.
